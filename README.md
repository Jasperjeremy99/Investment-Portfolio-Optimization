# Investment-Portfolio-Optimization

This repository contains a project focused on optimizing investment portfolios using various mathematical programming techniques, primarily implemented within an Excel workfile. The project explores Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models to determine optimal stock allocations based on objectives like maximizing returns, minimizing risk, and maximizing the Sharpe ratio.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide data-driven recommendations for constructing optimized investment portfolios. By applying mathematical programming techniques to historical stock data within Microsoft Excel, the project aims to help investors make informed decisions that align with their risk tolerance and return objectives.

## Files Overview

* **`investment_portfolio_optimization_presentation.pptx`**: This PowerPoint presentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including:
    * Introduction to portfolio optimization and stock selection criteria.
    * Details on the chosen 8 stocks and their risk classifications.
    * Explanation of the LP and ILP methodologies applied.
    * Summary of results for different optimization objectives (Maximize Return, Minimize Risk, Maximize Sharpe Ratio).
    * Comparison of model performances and a rationale for the preferred investment strategy.

* **`investment_portfolio_optimization_workfile.xlsx`**: This Excel workfile contains the main implementations of the portfolio optimization models. It includes:
    * The raw historical financial data for the selected stocks.
    * The setup and execution of Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models.
    * Worksheets dedicated to different optimization objectives: maximizing return, minimizing risk, and maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
    * Output tables and potentially sensitivity reports from the Excel Solver.
    * **Note:** To fully interact with the models, formulas, and Solver settings, this file requires Microsoft Excel.

## Dataset

The project utilizes data for 8 selected stocks, which is embedded within the `investment_portfolio_optimization_workfile.xlsx` file. This Excel file contains the historical financial data, inputs, and outputs of the various optimization scenarios.

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel (for data management, model implementation, and optimization via Solver).
* Microsoft PowerPoint (for project presentation).
* Principles of Linear Programming and Integer Linear Programming.

## Getting Started

To understand and explore this project:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Review the `investment_portfolio_optimization_presentation.pptx` for a high-level overview, methodologies, and key conclusions.
3.  Open `investment_portfolio_optimization_workfile.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel to examine the raw data, model formulations, and detailed results of the optimization scenarios. You will need Excel with the Solver Add-in enabled to interact with and potentially re-run the optimization models.
